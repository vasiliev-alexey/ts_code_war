Set objects are new JavaScript built-in objects defined since ECMAScript 2015

A Set lets you store unique values of any type. It comes with some useful methods like
.add, .clear, .has . . . BUT some "Set operations" are missing, like . . .
Intersection

A new set can be constructed by determining which members two sets have "in common".
The intersection of A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set of all things that are members of both A and B. If A ∩ B = ∅,
then A and B are said to be disjoint.
