Create the function fridayTheThirteenths that accepts a start year and an end year (inclusive), and returns all of the dates where the 13th of a month lands on a Friday in the given range of year(s).

The return value should be a string where each date is seperated by a space. The date should be formatted like 9/13/2014 where months do not have leading zeroes and are separated with forward slashes.

If no end year is given, only return friday the thirteenths during the start year.
